## Field Specifications

#### Event title

Event title. This is used to build the event slug, so brevity it appreciated where possible.

#### First date of event

This is the actual date of the event in the format `YYYY-DD-MM`. If the event spans multiple days, please enter the first day of the event for this field. (This date is used to sort events on the event listing page. To display a different date than the one used for event sorting, see the next field.)

#### Display date

This is the date to render on the page for users to see. If this is the same as the previous field _First date of event_ value, this can remain blank. An example in which different values may be an event that occurrs from July 10 to July 15, 2021. In this case, we would use `2021-07-10` for its `Event date` value and `July 10-15, 2021` as its _Display date_.

#### Event location

This is simply the location of the event. Most often this is listed as "city, state, country," but sometimes something like "virtual" or "Zoom" is appropriate for events such as webinars.

#### Is this a FABRIC-hosted event?:

True or False. Is FABRIC hosting this event (true), or is this event another organization is hosting (false)?

#### URL

This is the event's URL. This could be a registration link or an event overview page from the event's host. If this is a FABRIC hosted event, this is usually the URL for FABRIC's own registration page.

#### Tags

List any desired tags for this event. tags are used to identify similar news articles and events on the FABRIC website. For example, see all the articles and events tagged with NSF [here](https://fabric-testbed.net/tagged/NSF).

#### Description

This is a free field that accepts [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
